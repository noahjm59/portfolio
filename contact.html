      <p class="contact_text">To reach me, please see my resume or reach out to noahjm at umich dot edu. I am very open and receptive to unsolicited emails regarding anything such ranging from advice, to UMSI admissions advice, to a coffee chat, so do not hesitate to reach out. </p>
      <p class="contact_text">I am interested in the fields of finance and consulting, so feel free to reach out regarding employment, advice, or for a discussion regarding my own experiences going through the recruitment process for both. I would love to help younger members of the UMSI community go through their recuitment seasons, so I will be able to give anecdotes regarding the companies that I interviewed with, how I balanced recruitment and school, and any other help that someone may need.</p>
      <p class="contact_text">Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn - I would love to expand my network and help with anything I can. I find LinkedIn to be an invaluable tool for networking and finding people who can become resources to share their knowledge regarding a certain field or profession. I have had luck reaching out to recruiters as well as Michigan alumni, and recommend that you utilize it to its fullest extent.</p>
